# YouTube Home Page Clone

This simple web page showcases the knowledge I acquired while learning **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It represents one of my first projects built with React, with a focus on component-based development and responsive design.

All resources and layout ideas were inspired by a YouTube tutorial from **Web Dev Simplified**, used as a learning challenge.
